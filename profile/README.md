# CWRU Quants

Welcome to CWRU Quants, Case's first and only quantitative finance society. 

## Who are we?
We are a club of curious, hard-working students who want to learn more about quantitative finance. We are a supportive community that uplifts each other to do our best, and to
continually push boundaries and <i>trade beyond the possible</i>.

## What do we do?
Quant finance is applying math and computer science to help financial corporations make money. This can take form in many ways, such as algorithmic trading, machine learning, actuarial risk analysis, and more.   

As the only quantitative finance society on campus, we look to educate people on various topics in the field, and prepare our members for succcessful careers in industry. We host educational lectures on cool topics
[INSERT LINK HERE], work on individual projects, have guest speakers, career workshops, and more. If you're looking for a list of our historical General Board (GB) meetings, please refer to our "slides" repository.

## Why should you join us?
As a dedicated member of CWRU Quants, you are part of a community of likeminded individuals who are motivated to learn and push themselves past their coursework. Honestly, you will
probably cover a lot of the typical computer science coursework in our club, so you will not only be ahead in knowledge, but know how to practically it in your projects.   

Our club members and alumni network will be one of the strongest Case has ever seen. Being a member of our club will already put you one step ahead of the game,
with easier access to our current and past members.
